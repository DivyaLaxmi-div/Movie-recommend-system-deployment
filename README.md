# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System Deployment

This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user. The recommendations are based on key movie features like genres, keywords, overview, cast, and crew.

The project is built using **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn**, and deployed as a **Streamlit Web Application**.

## 📝 Project Overview
- Developed a **Content-Based Filtering** Recommendation System.
- Utilizes movie metadata (overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew) for feature extraction.
- Calculates **Cosine Similarity** between movies to recommend the top 5 similar movies.
- Deployed the model using **Streamlit** to make it accessible as a web application.
- Provides an interactive UI where users can select a movie and instantly get recommendations.
